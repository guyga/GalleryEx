# GalleryEx

The app's main screen shows all the user's Gallery.
Clicking on a picture adds it to a queue in which: 
1. A Gaussian blur is applied
2. Blurred image saved locally
3. Blurred image is uploaded through the Imgur API - https://api.imgur.com

Through the app's menu you can navigate to the Links screen, where all the uploaded links are listed. Clicking a link would open it in the browser
